Purpose, to demonstrate the usage of an interface during initial development of a project. The goal is to demonstrate that as long as you code to an interface, you can swap out the implementation as needed.

This project was built using visual studio 2019. In order to run this application:

1. Right click on the solution to restore NuGet packages. 
2. Right click on the MVC project "PlaceHolderProject," and click "View" to start the application in your default browser.

Note: if you wish to debug, instead of clicking "View" in step 2, click "Debug" then "Start new instance."
